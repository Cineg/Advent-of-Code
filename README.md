# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year containing folders for each day's challenges. Within each day's folder, you'll find:

-   Input files (`*.txt`): The puzzle input provided for that day. Sometimes test input as well.
-   Solution files: Code implementations for both parts of the challenge. Mostly in Python.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for personal enjoyment. While I strive for accuracy and efficiency in my implementations, they may not always be the most optimal or elegant solutions.
